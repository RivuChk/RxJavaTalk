# RxJavaTalk
A demo project consisting multiple RxJava examples that could be shown while talking on RxJava
I (Rivu Chakraborty) used this project to demonstrate some of the RxJava functionalities, while on a talk about RxJava, organised by **Google Developer Group Kolkata** on 11/11/2017
You may also have a look at the Android Project I used at the same workshop [https://github.com/RivuChk/NotesApp](https://github.com/RivuChk/NotesApp).


I may also use it for another Workshop on **Reactive Programming in Java** organised by Facebook Developer Circle Kolkata
